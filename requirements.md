Overview

The goal of this project is to create a basic dating app (preferably Node.js) backend (We

suggest heroku but you may use another platform).

You may assume that every person has a preference (age range, distance, gender preference

& religion). There is no description of how the DB should be defined, you may do whatever you

think is best. Try to think about edge cases, scalability issues that may arise in case there are

many users, performance and code readability.
